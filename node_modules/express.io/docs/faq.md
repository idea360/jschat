### Why did I write this?

After running through the agony of starting express, http, https, and socket.io servers from scratch a few dozen times, I decided that there had to be a better way to combine all of these powerful technologies together in a non-stupid manner.  

So, I set off to write a simple micro-framework to put everything together into one simple, elegant and high performance library.

### Do all of the examples work?

YES! I went through and painstakingly tested all of the examples.  Almost all of them can be copy-pasted directly from the docs.

### Is express.io a drop-in replacement for express?

Yes, just replace express with express.io, and you should have no issues with your current app.

### Is express.io ready for production?

Yes, we have been using it in production without issue.

### What is a "contrib shout out"?

Basically, if you fork the project, and add your github handle and a short message to the `CONTRIB` file, then I will merge your pull request.

This is so that you can brag to all of your friends that you're a contributor of __express.io__. :)

Some might call this stupid or gimmicky.  Well, put your pithy gripe in a pull request, and it will go up there for everyone to see how clever you are.
