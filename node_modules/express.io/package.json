Express.io is designed to be a superset of Express and Socket.io.  An easy to use drop-in replacement that makes it simple to get started with the realtime-web.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n\n__All of these examples work.__  I repeat, __they all work__.  Express.io is a very simple framework that allows you to build incredibly complex realtime apps with very little code.\n\n[All Examples](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#readme)\n\nOr view them bite size:\n\n* [Simple HTTP + IO Setup](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#simple-http--io-setup)\n* [Simple HTTPS + IO Setup](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#simple-https--io-setup)\n* [Routing](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#routing)\n* [Route Forwarding](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#route-forwarding)\n* [Broadcasting](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#broadcasting)\n* [Sessions](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#sessions)\n* [Rooms](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#rooms)\n* [Acknowledgements](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#acknowledgements)\n* [Realtime Canvas](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#realtime-canvas)\n* [Scaling with Redis](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples#scaling-with-redis)\n\nTo run the examples from git, do the following:\n\n```js\ngit clone https://github.com/techpines/express.io\ncd express.io/examples\nnpm install\n```\n\nThen you'll be ready to run the example code with a simple:\n\n```\nnode app.js\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis should help you get a birds eye view of the __express.io__ architecture.  Simple and lean.
